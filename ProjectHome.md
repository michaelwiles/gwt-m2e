# GWT M2E Connector #
Manages Supersource and Resource Folders for GWT-Projects

## Features ##
**Supersource:**
It adds the Supersource-Folder to the Buildpath to remove Eclipse-Compiler-Errors for wrong Package-declarations.

**Resource Bug:**
Using @Source in Maven Projects, causes a Bug, because the Eclipse-Plugin dont see resources in the resource Folders of Maven. To fix this, this plugin removes the exclusion of all resource-folders for Eclipse.

## Limitations ##
For now, the Plugin only supports `<`super-source/`>` without path Arguments. (Patches welcome)

Workarround: add new emul.gwt-xml with `<`super-source/`>` directly inside your "emul"-Folder and include it in your `<`main`>`.gwt.xml.

## Usage ##
The Plugin starts in the "Maven->Update Project Configuration..." cycle. (Rightclick on the Project->Maven->Update Project Configuration...).

The Plugin goes active for any Maven Project that uses maven-gwt-plugin:resource.

**IMPORTANT:** The Plugin onlys works, when you **don't ignore** the M2E-Connector for maven-gwt-plugin. When you have added this ignore to your pom.xml's, you need to remove that.
